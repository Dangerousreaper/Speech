Hello, my name is Eduardo Ramirez Moreno.
I am currently a student attending Antelope Valley College, with the goal to graduate with an Associates Degree for Transfer in English.
Once I have gotten my associates, I will attend California State University, Northridge, and get a Bachelor's degree in English,
with my goal being
to become a journalist.</P>
<P> To talk a little bit more about myself, I was born in Calexico, Mexico on June 1st 1998. In order to secure a better future for myself, my mother decided to take my brother and myself and
move to the United States of America, where I have been located since the age of 2. Initially, it was frustrating being unable to communicate with other people due to the language barrier, but
I was inspired by the various teachers I had through the course of elementary school, and I eventually became enamoured with the English language.</P>

<P>I love being able to speak and write in English, and
it is a dream for me to become a journalist so that I can use my words and wisdom to inform others. I've worked on my speaking skills over the years, and am confident in my ability to write and
conduct myself when speaking. Being able to get a job in the field of English is a dream of mine, and I hope that you taking the time to look at my portfolio means that you are considering giving me a position
which can help me flourish my talents.</P>
